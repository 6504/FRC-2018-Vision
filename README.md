# FRC-2018-Vision
[Robot Code](https://github.com/6504/FRC-2018) | **Vision Code** | [Dashboard](https://github.com/6504/JagwiresDash)

This code was written for use on our team's Raspberry Pi for vision processing using sample WPILib code and [GRIP](https://wpiroboticsprojects.github.io/GRIP/).

It was planned to be used during the 2018 competiton, but since the vision targets were not compatible with our autonomous, we elected to run a CameraServer off of our RoboRIO for streaming purposes only, and merged development into [FRC-2018](https://github.com/6504/FRC-2018). This repository has been kept as a means to keep development history intact. The code for the CameraServer can be found in the [Robot.java](https://github.com/6504/FRC-2018/blob/master/MyRobot/src/org/usfirst/frc6504/MyRobot/Robot.java) file.
